## What is this?
Welcome at the GitHub repository collection of the foundation for the open-source software suite known as KERI, the code of which 
resides under the [WebOfTrust organization on GitHub](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/) with the 
specification and standardization happening at the [Trust Over IP](https://github.com/trustoverip/) (ToIP) Foundation.

## Why?
Maturation of the tooling: Finish KERI's code base and build "One-click KERI" through the 5 W's: Wallet, Witness, Watcher, Web, and Wizard. 

## For - and by who?
Members, donors, supporters, coders, users, and adepts of the KERI Suite who are interested in - or work on the projects visit this GitHub repository collection. A diverse group of contributors maintains the repos here. However, the role of Dr. Samuel M. Smith, the inventor and lead developer of KERI, is prominent.

## What for?
This user account on github focuses on the open-source development of tools, governance, and education for KERI implementations.

## Which way
Development in working groups. The foundation provides the financial resources to overcome any barriers. 
Donors support with general donations and directed funding.

## How to contribute?
Become a member, donor, supporter, and/or coder. See the [website](https://keri.foundation) for details.

## When?
Since 2024, although we hope to finish One-click-KERI in a year, the foundation will persist in steering development in the coming decades.
